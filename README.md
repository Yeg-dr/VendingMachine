**ðŸ¥¤ Vending Machine with Raspberry Pi**

This is a complete vending machine system built using a Raspberry Pi 3 and a touchscreen monitor. It features a customer interface, an admin panel, relay-based control logic, and a mock payment system simulating real-world card transactions.

This project was developed as a real-world engineering challenge during my university studies and represents my first hands-on experience with hardware integration and embedded GUI systems.

ðŸš€ Features

ðŸ‘¤ Customer Panel

Simple and touch-friendly GUI built with tkinter

Displays a 6Ã—10 grid of items (name, price, and stock)

Items are loaded from a JSON file

Handles product selection, mock payment processing, and relay triggering

Disables out-of-stock items automatically


ðŸ›  Admin Panel

Secure login for admin access

View and edit items and stock levels

Add or remove products dynamically

Real-time activity logs

Restore item data from a backup


âš¡ Hardware Integration

Controls a 6Ã—10 matrix of products using 2 relays (one for row, one for column)

Connected to a touchscreen HDMI display

Communicates with a mock payment API in development phase (simulates behavior of a real card reader used in production)


ðŸªµ Logging System

Logs customer purchases, payment outcomes, and system events

Logs are viewable in the admin panel
